# Math-Graph
Java version of a math graphing

Overview: This project contains a mildly functional calculator program with previously and newly implemented algorithms and a passable window interface. It contains multiple threads and a large amount of classes and packages.

Outcome: Although the initial goal was not fulfilled I managed to conceptualize inheritance and multiclass interactions a lot better then I had before this project. I was also able to work with an interface a lot better then I had before.

Challanges: One challange that I faced in making this program was bug fixing. Normally bug fixing would only take a few minutes, however with a program of this magnitude, finding a bug could take hours and was very time consuming. In the future I hope to organize my programs in a better was so degugging wont be as large of an issue as it was in this project.
